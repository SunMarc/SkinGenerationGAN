# SkinGenerationGAN for Skinless Mannequin

## Introduction
The virtual try-on experience is the future of fashion e-commerce. In the world of 2D virtual try-on, it is difficult to deform a garment so that it perfectly matches the pose and morphology of the model. To simplify the process, the garment is deformed as best as possible, and the visible parts of the mannequin's skin and the ends of the garment (head, hands, feet) are then re-generated.

The objective of this project is to create a model that will be able to generate missing parts of skin to reconstruct a complete image of a mannequin wearing a deformed set of clothes. The input data used in this project will be:
- The deformed clothes
- The head and feet of the mannequin
- The openpose keypoints of the mannequin
- The semantic segmentation of the skin (optional)

## Dataset
The Deepfashion dataset was used for this project, which is a public large-scale fashion database. This dataset was chosen because it has a variety of poses and clothes types, including upper-body clothes, lower-body clothes, and full-body clothes. The poses include frontal view, side view, back view, zoom-out view, zoom-in view, and stand-alone view. The dataset also includes semantic segmentation maps for some images.

## Algorithm
We chose to explore algorithms that perform semantic segmentation as it was the missing piece in our project. For the skin generation model, we started with a simple architecture to get some initial results. Then, we moved on to investigate adversarial networks as they typically perform well for this type of task. After considering DCGAN, we switched to Pix2Pix CGAN. We slightly modified the model to take multiple images as input and performed several ablation tests to determine the best parameters.

## Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the quality of the images generated by the different models, we introduced some evaluation metrics (FID, PSNR, MSE). These metrics provide us with a comprehensive way to evaluate the performance of our models and make improvements where necessary.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project provides a solution for generating missing parts of the skin of a skinless mannequin wearing deformed clothes. The project leverages state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques to generate high-quality skin images that blend seamlessly with the existing clothes.
